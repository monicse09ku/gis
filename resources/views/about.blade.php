	<p>The Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative is the first global data hub on human trafficking, publishing harmonized data from counter-trafficking organizations around the world. Launched in November 2017, the goal of CTDC is to break down information-sharing barriers and equip the counter-trafficking community with up to date, reliable data on human trafficking. CTDC data has so far been accessed by users in over 150 countries and territories.</p>

	<p>Historically, it has been difficult to make data on human trafficking readily accessible to analysts, academics, practitioners and policy-makers. Data on human trafficking are often highly sensitive raising a range of privacy and civil liberty concerns where the risk of identifying data subjects can be high and the consequences severe.</p>

	<p>It is widely recognized that one of the foremost challenges in developing targeted counter-trafficking responses and measuring their impact is the lack of reliable, high-quality information. Data on human trafficking are often highly sensitive, raising a range of privacy and civil liberty concerns where the risk of identifying data subjects can be high and the consequences severe. For the first time, CTDC leverages modern technology to overcome these obstacles allow unprecedented public access to the worldâ€™s largest datasets on human trafficking. Bringing together global data in one platform will strengthen and empower local, national and international institutions to eradicate crimes of trafficking and exploitation.</p>
