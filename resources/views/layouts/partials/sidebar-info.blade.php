<p>The data in the map may take a moment to load.</p>

<p>This map presents corridors of trafficking, between victims’ country of citizenship and country of exploitation. Shaded countries signal countries that belong to at least one corridor.</p>

<p>The victim of trafficking data presented in these maps come from either the case management services or the hotline reports from CTDC contributing organizations. These data have been collected since 2002 in the case of case management services and 2015 in the case of hotline services.</p>

<p>These data reflect the victims assisted/identified/referred/reported to the contributing organizations, which may not represent all victims identified within a country. Nevertheless, the larger the sample size for a given country (or, the more victims displayed on the map for a given country), the more representative the data are of the identified victim of trafficking population.</p>

<p>A larger number of identified victims of trafficking does not imply that there is a larger number of undetected victims of trafficking.</p>

<p>In addition, samples of identified victims of trafficking cannot be considered random samples of the wider population of victims of trafficking (which includes unidentified victims), since counter-trafficking agencies may be more likely to identify some trafficking cases rather than others. However, with this caveat in mind, identified victims of trafficking still tend to be considered as representative of the wider population, particularly given that the availability of other data sources is close to zero. Further information on this type of data can be found on the CTDC website, on the FAQs page.</p>

<p>This map is based on the Global Dataset hosted on the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) prior to k-anonymization. Prior to k-anonymization, the Global Dataset includes information about approximately 91,000 victims of human trafficking of 169 nationalities who experienced exploitation in 172 countries. The k-anonymized version of the dataset, which contains fewer cases, is available for download here.</p>

<p>Please note that for confidentiality reasons, this map only displays the three largest corridors for each country of citizenship/exploitation and will not display victims’ characteristics for corridors with fewer than 100 victims.</p>
